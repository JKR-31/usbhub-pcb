# Opensource USB Hub PCB


I have looking to make a custom USB Hub for a project but I couldnt find any of them that worked and using the chip GL850G.
The chip is pretty old and cheap, but in my case I didnt need to use any of the fast transfering USB3, probably the next version can be based on this schematic.

I have took the schematic from a chinese website and re-written on eagle + designed the PCB, which is not the best compact and neat design but it worked as prototype.

I am offering all the files and part lists in case someone will want to make a custom USB Hub.
